## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-cep-vue-cli using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-cep-vue-cli
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
# Recommended inside ../AppData/Roaming/CEP/extensions
yo cep-vue-cli

# Prompt for name
# Prompt for template
# Prompt for Adobe apps to be included in manifest and typescript
# Prompt for base localhost port
```

- `npm run help` - A full list of the commands available and descriptions.
- `npm run switch` - Reports whether in developer or production context and can switch automatically.
- `npm run update` - Reports current version of panel in manifest and prompts to update Major, Minor, or Micro.
- `npm run register` - Reports the current user data (if any) and prompts to save new info to be used in certificates.
- `npm run sign` - Automatically stages and signs the extension, placing it in a `./archive` directory within the current panel.
